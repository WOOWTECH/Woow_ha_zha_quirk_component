"""Unified HA-core climate entities for the WOOW / Simon AC panels.

ZHA's own climate entity (built from a Zigbee Thermostat cluster) is too limited for
these devices: its hvac_modes have no `fan_only`, its fan is hardcoded to auto/on (no
low/med/high), and it has no presets. So instead of producing a climate via the quirk,
this platform creates a normal **HA-core ClimateEntity** that wraps the quirk's existing
entities and exposes one combined climate:

  hvac_mode  off / cool / heat / fan_only   <- power switch + mode select
  fan_mode   low / medium / high / auto     <- fan select
  preset     (device-specific)              <- a select (scenario / sleep)
  target_temperature                        <- number (Thermostat setpoint)
  current_temperature                       <- sensor (Thermostat local_temperature)

It is auto-discovered: on HA start it scans the device registry for any known device
(see DEVICE_SPECS) and resolves the backing entities by their stable ZHA unique-id
suffixes, then hides them so only the single climate entity remains on the device card.

Staying in sync with the device is the hard part, because everything this entity shows is
second-hand. Three rules, all learned the hard way on real hardware (see
docs/adr/0001-backing-state-semantics.md):

  * The power switch is the only authority on off-vs-running. If it cannot be read, the
    hvac_mode is left alone -- never inferred from the mode select.
  * A backing entity that is *absent* from the state machine is ZHA rebuilding it and means
    nothing; a backing entity that is explicitly *unavailable* means the device is
    unreachable and makes this entity unavailable too.
  * The state-change subscription is a fast path, not a guarantee. A 60 s reconcile
    (SCAN_INTERVAL) bounds how long a missed delivery can keep this entity stale, and a
    5 min platform watchdog (WATCHDOG_INTERVAL) rebuilds a climate that has vanished.

Supported devices:
  - 14-66E7109TY  (_TZC200_qbuzgrdocufrqgdu / SM0308F) — Tuya 0xEF00 panel
  - 8-58E7101     (_TZ2000_cykrrj2x / SM0308C)        — standard-ZCL fan-coil thermostat

To add another device, append a DeviceSpec to DEVICE_SPECS.
