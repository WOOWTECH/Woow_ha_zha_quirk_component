"""ZHA Quirk (v3) for the Simon i7 0-10V Smart Dimming Remote Switch.

渥屋 catalog: "17-70E857TY"
Manufacturer: _TZ3210_qe3d5gga   (was _TZ3000_qe3d5gga — see "Identity history")
Model:        TS1002
IEEE (test rig): e0:79:8d:ff:fe:b2:d0:42

Identity history — this SKU changed its manufacturer string on OTA
------------------------------------------------------------------
The bench unit was updated on 2026-08-20 and came back as a *different
manufacturer* on the same IEEE:

                        | before             | after
  manufacturer (0x0004) | _TZ3000_qe3d5gga   | _TZ3210_qe3d5gga
  app_version  (0x0001) | 129 (0x81)         | 134 (0x86)
  model        (0x0005) | TS1002             | TS1002 (unchanged)
  EP1/EP2 input         | ... 0xE002         | ... 0xE002 + 0xEF00 (new)

``QuirkBuilder`` matches on manufacturer + model, so the update dropped the
match outright: ZHA reported ``quirk_class = zigpy.device.Device`` and the
device reverted to stock entities (2 switches, Identify, 2 firmware rows) with
no error, no log line and no unavailable entity.  This file now registers the
NEW string only — **a unit still on ``_TZ3000_qe3d5gga`` gets no quirk from
here.**  That is a deliberate trade, recorded in
``docs/adr/0006-ota-can-change-the-manufacturer-match-key.md``.

``app_version`` is written down here rather than matched on: ZHA reads only
manufacturer_name and model_identifier at join, so the value is not populated
when quirks are selected (ADR 0003 measured the same defect on
``firmware_version_filter``).

Both questions the update opened were settled at the panel on 2026-08-20, with
an operator present and zigpy debug capture running:
  * ``0xEF00`` carries the per-gang **minimum brightness** — see its own section
    below.  Gang state and slide-dim level do NOT travel over it: every state
    change in that session arrived as a standard ZCL ``Report_Attributes`` on
    0x0006 / 0x0008, and the cluster stayed silent throughout.  That silence was
    first read as "the device never uses it"; the real cause was that nothing had
    addressed it with the command code this firmware accepts (2026-08-20).
  * **All five operator-verified claims below still hold on app_version 134.**
    Each carries its own 134 evidence inline.

What the device is
------------------
Per the product manual (Simon i7 "Smart Dimming Remote Switch, ZigBee to 0-10V
set"), this is a *wall controller* that pairs with a separate Simon 0-10V
converter module ("N65E0-0017 wireless converter 0-10V with on-off relay" +
"N6524-0412 ZigBee control module") which performs the actual 0-10V dimming.
The wall unit sends on/off + slide-to-dim signals and carries an indicator /
status LED.  The paired unit here has two gangs (endpoints 1 and 2).

Real signature (mains powered, ZigBee Router)
---------------------------------------------
  Endpoint 1 & 2 (identical):
    profile 0x0104, device_type 0x0104 (DIMMER_SWITCH)
    input  (server): 0x0000 Basic, 0x0003 Identify, 0x0004 Groups,
                     0x0006 OnOff, 0x0008 LevelControl, 0xE002 (Tuya mfg),
                     0xEF00 (Tuya MCU — app_version 134 and later only)
    output (client): 0x0003, 0x0006, 0x0008, 0x0019 OTA, 0x0300 Color
  Endpoint 242: Green Power proxy (ZHA skips it)

Stock ZHA behaviour vs. what we want
------------------------------------
Stock ZHA exposes the device as a generic 2-endpoint device: 2 OnOff switches
plus an Identify button and two per-endpoint firmware/OTA "update" entities,
with NO control for the indicator / status LED.

This quirk (modelled on the sibling ``simon_i7_s2100.py``) replaces the stock
OnOff with ``TuyaZBOnOffAttributeCluster`` on each gang.  That:
  * carries the gang ``on_off`` state (exposed as a read-only binary_sensor, see
    the control note below), and
  * surfaces the Tuya indicator-LED attribute ``backlight_mode`` (0x8001),
    which we expose as a single device-global "Status Light" select on EP1.

It also exposes each gang's slide-dim level from the standard LevelControl
cluster as a read-only percent ``sensor`` (see the dimming note below).

It trims the device to the desired set (2 binary_sensors + 2 sensors + 1 select):
  * suppress the control-less default Switch on each gang (replaced by a
    binary_sensor — see the control note),
  * suppress the native StartUpOnOff "power-on behaviour" select on both gangs
    (this device has no Tuya power-on datapoint; the attribute does nothing —
    re-checked on app_version 134: 0x4003 reads None on both endpoints and a
    write leaves it None),
  * suppress the Identify button, and
  * collapse the duplicate per-endpoint firmware/OTA "update" entities.

Status-light values are operator-verified live (see ``WoowStatusLight``).

Dimming note (operator-verified 2026-08-19)
-------------------------------------------
Re-verified on app_version 134, 2026-08-20: both gangs still push.  A tap emits
``Report_Attributes(0x0000, Bool)`` on 0x0006 and a slide emits
``Report_Attributes(0x0000, uint8)`` on 0x0008 — gang 1 walked 170 -> 255 -> 240
-> 137 -> 23 and gang 2 walked 28 -> 63 -> 146 -> 229 -> 255 -> 225 -> 138 -> 23,
each report reaching the sensor within a second.  No polling involved.

``current_level`` (0x0008 / 0x0000) on each gang **does** record the slide-dim
level, contrary to the earlier assumption that it was a static parameter.  Live
over-the-air reads (``allow_cache=False``) while an operator slid gang 2 from
minimum to maximum and back walked the value ``19 -> 196 -> 255 -> 133 -> 0``
over eight seconds, with the gang's ``on_off`` toggling either side of the
gesture as a positive control.  The value **persists** after the gesture — the
earlier flat readings of 0 / 1 / 3 were genuine levels left over from previous
slides, not a dead attribute.  Full scale reads 255, not the ZCL 254, which is
why ``WoowLevelControlCluster`` exists.

ZHA binds and configures reporting for current_level (min 1 s / max 900 s /
change 1) and the device accepts it, so the sensors update on push — no polling.
A device that was paired before this quirk gained the sensors needs one
"Reconfigure device" for that binding to be written.

The rest of the LevelControl attributes (0x0010-0x0014, 0x4000) answer
UNSUPPORTED_ATTRIBUTE, and the manufacturer min/max-brightness attributes the
sibling SM0502 carries (0xFC00 / 0xFC01) do not exist here.

Minimum brightness, per gang — Tuya DP 103 / 104 (measured 2026-08-20)
----------------------------------------------------------------------
The Tuya app offers a per-circuit "minimum brightness", and it is the setting
that decides where a slide-to-dim gesture bottoms out.  It is NOT a display
scale: with the minimum at 10 the slide floors at raw ``current_level`` 23 (9 %),
at 50 it floors at 125 (49 %), at 5 it floors at 10 (4 %).  The panel remaps its
whole travel onto ``[minimum .. 255]``.

Sniffed off the Tuya gateway (PAN 0x5d4b / ch20) while an operator set both
circuits, then reproduced from ZHA:

  write path : cluster 0xEF00, **server command 0x04 ``send_data``**, endpoint 1
               DP 0x67 (103) = gang 1, DP 0x68 (104) = gang 2
               type 0x02 (value), 4 bytes, the value is a PERCENT
  read path  : LevelControl ``min_level`` (0x0002) on the gang's own endpoint is
               a live **read-only mirror** of that DP — writing DP 104 = 25 makes
               ep2 ``min_level`` read 25, writing 10 makes it read 10.  Writes to
               0x0002 itself are refused with ``READ_ONLY 0x88`` on both gangs.

Two traps, both paid for in full:

  * **zhaquirks writes datapoints with ``set_data`` (0x00) by default, and this
    firmware answers ``UNSUP_CLUSTER_COMMAND 0x81`` to that.**  Hence
    ``add_to_registry(mcu_write_command=TUYA_SEND_DATA)`` below — without it the
    numbers look like they work and change nothing.  This is also why the cluster
    appeared unused: nobody had ever spoken its dialect.
  * **A DP write always reports success.**  ``TuyaMCUCluster.write_attributes()``
    returns a hard-coded SUCCESS and updates the local attribute regardless of
    what the device answers, so the entity showed 9 while the device was
    rejecting the frame outright.  Confirm every DP write by reading ``min_level``
    back — never by looking at the entity.  See
    ``docs/adr/0007-tuya-dp-writes-never-fail-loudly.md``.

The 5..50 bounds on the two numbers are **inferred, not read**: they are the
values the device received when the operator drove the Tuya app slider to each
end, captured on the air.  The app's own labelled range was never read, because
by the time the question mattered the device had left the Tuya network.  Whether
the app also offers a *maximum* brightness is likewise unconfirmed — no second
datapoint was ever seen, and the two gangs' datapoints are fully independent.

Control note (operator-verified)
--------------------------------
Re-verified on app_version 134, 2026-08-20: all four commands (on/off x EP1/EP2)
came back ``DefaultResponse(status=UNSUP_CLUSTER_COMMAND: 129)`` **from the
device**, and the operator watching the panel saw no lamp move.

This is a *remote* — its server OnOff cluster rejects ``on``/``off`` with
``UNSUP_CLUSTER_COMMAND`` (the real 0-10V load is driven by the separate Simon
converter module, not present in ZHA), so a ``switch`` entity could never
control it.  Each gang only *reports* its ``on_off`` state when physically
tapped, so we model the two gangs as read-only **binary_sensor** entities
(Gang 1 / Gang 2) that mirror the physical state.

    slide that reaches the top therefore blanked the Brightness sensor to
    ``unknown`` mid-sweep (operator-verified: 0 -> 70 % -> unknown -> 64 % -> 0).

    Clamping 255 to the ZCL maximum 254 costs nothing — the two are the same
