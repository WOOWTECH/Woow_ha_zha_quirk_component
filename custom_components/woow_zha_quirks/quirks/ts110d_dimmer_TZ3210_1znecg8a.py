"""ZHA Quirk for Simon 1-Gang Smart Dimmer (TS110D / _TZ3210_1znecg8a).

Device info:
  - Model:        TS110D  (Tuya TS110E dimmer family)
  - Manufacturer: _TZ3210_1znecg8a
  - Chip:         Silicon Labs (Tuya Zigbee 3.0)
  - IEEE:         f0:82:c0:ff:fe:c9:24:97
  - WOOW/Tuya:    15-66E8015 — Simon M7 一位智能调光开关 (category tgkg)

This is a standard ZCL dimmer (device_type 0x0101 DIMMABLE_LIGHT) on a single
endpoint (EP1: OnOff 0x0006 + LevelControl 0x0008), but it belongs to the Tuya
TS110E firmware family, which has two quirks:

  1. Brightness is *also* reported on the manufacturer attribute 0xF000, but on
     this variant in the SAME 0..254 domain as current_level (verified on
     hardware: a 50% set reported 0xF000≈127). Unlike the older _TZ3210_ngqk6jia,
     this variant honours standard move_to_level* commands **while the lamp is
     already on** (it presented as a working standard dimmer before this quirk);
     while the lamp is off it answers SUCCESS and acts on neither the level nor
     the implicit on, which the quirk works around by sending On first — see
     "Level commands need the lamp already on" below. We must NOT route writes
     through the Tuya custom command 0x00F0 — the upstream
     F000LevelControlCluster.command() override returns None for that path and
     crashes zha's light.async_turn_on ("TypeError: 'NoneType' object is not
     subscriptable" at move_to_level_with_on_off). We therefore keep standard
     command handling and only mirror 0xF000 reports onto the standard
     current_level (0x0000), copied through directly (no rescaling), so
     brightness changed at the wall is reflected in Home Assistant.
  2. Several Tuya manufacturer attributes carry features the Tuya app exposes but
     ZHA hides without a quirk:
       LevelControl 0xFC03 — min brightness   (cached 77)
       LevelControl 0xFC04 — max brightness   (cached 255)
       LevelControl 0xFC01 — dimming mode / curve (cached 2, role unconfirmed)
       LevelControl 0xFC02 — bulb type (LED/INCANDESCENT/HALOGEN)
       OnOff        0x8001 — backlight / indicator LED mode (cached 1)

Tuya DP map (from the WOOW app, for reference):
  DP1  switch_led_1     bool     on/off
  DP2  bright_value_1   1..255   brightness
  DP3  brightness_min_1 1..255   -> 0xFC03
  DP5  brightness_max_1 1..255   -> 0xFC04
  DP6  countdown_1      0..86400 s
  DP26 switch_backlight bool
  DP102 light_mode_1    enum     none / enable_white / enable_yellow

We reuse TuyaZBOnOffAttributeCluster (provides backlight_mode + power_on_state)
and the TuyaBulbType enum from the upstream ts110e module, but use a plain
LevelControl subclass (NOT F000LevelControlCluster) for the reasons in (1) above.

Quirk adds / fixes:
  1. Reliable on/off + brightness via standard ZCL, with 0xF000->current_level
     read mirroring.
  2. Min / Max brightness (0xFC03 / 0xFC04) as writable config numbers in
     percent, always written as a pair — see "Min/max only commit when written
     as a pair" below.
  3. Indicator (backlight) LED mode select (OnOff 0x8001) — labels mapped to the
     app's DP102 (none / enable_white / enable_yellow).
  4. Suppress the useless default LevelControl config entities and the raw
     manufacturer-attribute auto-entities.
  5. Remove both power-on selects (standard StartUpOnOff + Tuya power_on_state).

Min/max only commit when written as a pair (issue #3)
----------------------------------------------------
0xFC03 / 0xFC04 are ordinary writable uint16 attributes: every write is answered
SUCCESS, echoed back in an unsolicited report, read back correctly from the
device, and persisted across a mains power cycle. None of that means the
firmware is using the value. It keeps a separate *committed* window, and only
replaces it when it receives min and max close together. A lone write, or a
pair more than about a second apart, updates storage and leaves the committed
window untouched — the device goes on clamping to the previous one.

Measured directly, lamp on throughout, nothing else varied (2026-08-14):

    write 0xFC03=102 then 0xFC04=204, 2.5 s apart
        stored 102/204   commanded 40 -> 51, 254 -> 230   (previous window!)
    write 0xFC03=64  then 0xFC04=242, 0.1 s apart
        stored  64/242   commanded 40 -> 64, 254 -> 242   (committed)

This quirk therefore always sends both attributes in ONE frame, which is
strictly tighter than the ~100 ms pair the Tuya gateway sends and needs no
timing luck. Once committed the window survives an OnOff cycle and a 10 s mains
outage; a re-pair puts the device back on the factory 77/255.

That single rule explains the entire history of this bug. The Tuya app always
worked because the gateway writes the pair ~100 ms apart and repeats it three
times. Every ZHA test that ever "proved" the attributes were inert — including
the ones in issue #3 that led to demoting them to read-only sensors — wrote the
two attributes about 1.5 s apart.

Do not be fooled by a read-back: reading 0xFC03/0xFC04 from the device returns
the stored value, not the committed one, so the two can disagree indefinitely.
The only honest test is to command a level and see where it lands.

Level commands need the lamp already on (issue #4)
--------------------------------------------------
move_to_level_with_on_off (and its move/step siblings) is answered with a
SUCCESS default response while the lamp is off, after which the firmware acts
on neither the implicit "on" nor the level. Home Assistant's "turn on at
brightness X" is exactly that command, so the lamp stayed dark while HA
believed it was lit. Confirmed still present on 2026-08-14: with the lamp off,
light.turn_on brightness=200 left on_off false (the level was stored, and only
took effect the next time the lamp was switched on some other way).

TS110DLevelControl.command() therefore sends OnOff On first whenever the cached
on_off says the lamp is off. The Tuya gateway never hits this because it drives
level with the private 0x00F0 command and never uses move_to_level* at all;
routing through 0x00F0 was considered and rejected, because the upstream
F000LevelControlCluster.command() override returns None on that path and
crashes zha's light.async_turn_on (see (1) above).

Everything below was tested and is NOT the gate. Do not re-litigate without new
evidence; all of it is on the wire in captures/ts110d_mfgcode_ch25.pcap:

  - Tuya "attribute read" spell (BaseEnchantedDevice) — no effect.
  - The Tuya gateway's join handshake replayed frame for frame, on a fresh join
    (single-frame six-attribute spell, Basic 0xFFDE write, Basic cmd 0xF0, the
    0xFEFE-bearing cluster probes, the duplicated probe round, the trailing
    Basic 0x0001 read) — no effect.
  - The coordinator's ZDO manufacturer code. The device really does send
    Node_Desc_req to 0x0000 on every join, and the Tuya gateway answers 0x1049
    where zigpy answers 0xABCD — but making an EmberZNet NCP answer 0x1049
    (EZSP frame 0x15, confirmed on the wire) changed nothing, and the limits
    work with the stock 0xABCD.
  - The lamp being on or off at write time. It looked decisive for one round of
    testing and is not: a pair written 0.1 s apart commits with the lamp off,
    and a pair written 2.5 s apart fails to commit with the lamp on.
  - OnOff off->on cycle, ZHA restart, mains power cycle, factory reset — no
    effect. The Tuya gateway is equally factory-reset at pairing and its limits
    work, so the reset was never the difference either.
  - The Tuya 0xEF00 DP path — the device exposes 0xEF00 on EP1, but the gateway
    never used it for min/max; it wrote the same 0xFC03/0xFC04.

NOTE: the real bulb-type attribute (0xFC01 vs 0xFC02) is unresolved — 0xFC02
reads as unsupported on this variant, so bulb/dimming-mode attrs are declared
but not exposed.
